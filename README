About:
------

  Varix has two main aims:

  1. As a shell to perform quick word searches (build, anagram and pattern),
  mostly duplicating the functionality of the late lamented Lexpert
  [http://www.valuecube.com/lexpert/].

  2. To explore the idea of a language to perform complex word queries, somewhat
  akin to zyzzyva [http://www.zyzzyva.net], but based on scripts rather than a GUI

Features:
---------

  * Anagram
  * Build
  * Pattern
  * Single character wildcard (.)
  * Multi character wildcard (*)
  * Basic set operations (and, or, diff)

Examples:
---------
